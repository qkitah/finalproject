				<p><strong>My comments:</strong> I visited both locations. The one in the Jane Hotel (west village) it is great for a friday or saturday night. If you are on the mood for going for drinks after you should definetly check out The Jane. The food is great! The cous cous is worth the try..yummm </p>

				<p><strong>My comments:</strong> I discovererd Sarabeth as soon as I landed in NY, as there was one location right next to my hotel. The food here is GREAT, and they are famous for the jams (which I now regularly shop for at the supermarket). It is a very well known place. Be prepared to make a line! </p>

				<p><strong>My comments:</strong> Went here with Rochi's sister, Isa. It is a magical place, it has shared tables, a very rustic look, and they use cultery that is to die for. Definetly check it out, the french experience is worth it. In a side note, I love the branding. </p>

				<p><strong>My comments:</strong> This is probably an institution here in NY. Everyone speaks very highly about the banana pudding, which I have to say is delicious. Still, If I have to choose only ONE thing, I'd go for the key lime pie. GREAT TIP: the one on the UWS is open until 11pm</p>

				<p><strong>My comments:</strong> Cool place, always packed, and with reason. The brunch is served until late and you can't go wrong with ANYTHING on the menu. I have been here for dinner and brunch, regardless the time, impecable service and great food. If it is too full down the block you'll find <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/cafe-select-new-york"> Cafe Select</a> which I love for the thousands of lights in the cieling.

				<p><strong>My comments:</strong> The one in TribeCa is a great option when Maman is full.You can do lunch if you had breakfast - their salads are a masterpiece:) They have alfajores that deal with my cravings for sweet argentinean treats. Their granola is generous and done with proper greek yoghurt. Definetly get coffee here!</p>

				</div>		
				<p><strong>My comments:</strong> This is the fish-heaven place. The minute I stepped inside this place I fell in love. I was there with Pati, Joce, Amanda, Javi and Pau for lunch on a Sunday. There is SO much light and open space you almost feel outdoors (only that bwtter, because it was a hot-sauna outside). I had the tuna Poke (my all time favorite), that although it is a starter it is as filling as an entre. Plus, the restaurant supportslocal farmers, sustainability and fishing from local fisherman. </p>

			</div>
				<p><strong>My comments:</strong> A few years ago, the husband of a cousin of mine introduced me to the (until then unknown for me) world of olive oil. there is such an inmense variety that it would take me a life time to try them all. Later, a spanish friend of mine started an olive oil business with her brother in portugal and I've learned a whole deal of things form her. Discovering Fig & Olive was a very pleasent surprise. The food is very fresh and flavors are well achieved. The fig gorgonzola tartlet and the Chilean sea Bass were on point. We had an olive oil tasting between courses which wasa nice surprise </p>

					</ul>
				</div>
					<p><strong>My comments:</strong> Make some time in the agenda and book lunch at this magical place. If you are visiting during summer, it is even better. The place, the service and the food will make you fall in love. It is a little bit pricey tho..</p>

					</ul>
				</div>
					<p><strong>My comments:</strong> I'll start by saying that having worked almost a year in a street food company this two markets are HEAVEN for me. It is the perfect place when you are with many people and you cannot decide in one type of food, as this markets have it all. They reunite the best of the best of street vendors in an indoor space (great for winter). You have so many delicious options that vary from pastries to pizza and hotdogs. Oh, and coffee... Toby's estate Coffee...but that is another chapter.</p>

					<li><i class="fa fa-cutlery"></i> Type of food: Venezuelan</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
					<p><strong>My comments:</strong> My love for arepas started during my masters, where I learned how to cook them. It is a one way trip. For those who never tried them, is like a sandwich made with corn flour.I love Reina Pepeada and the Peluda. The tequeños (cheese sticks) and tostones (green plantains with toppings) are the to-go starters. The location in Manhattan is tiny, but the one in Williamsburg has a nice terrace in the back.</p>

			<h5>Cafe Mogador</h5>
				<div id="info">
					<ul>
					<li><i class="fa fa-map-pin"></i> 	Location: East Village • Williamsburg</li>

					<li><i class="fa fa-cutlery"></i> Type of food: Moroccan/Mediterranean</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
					<p><strong>My comments:</strong> If you are keen of mediterrenean food this a place to visit. Falafel, hummus, cucumber yogurt, pita bread, lamb, cous-cous..what else can you ask for?
					The menu also has "traditional" brunch options (eggs, french toast, etc).
					I only've been to the Williamsburg location which has an in-door garden that I am in love with. It is a very popular place, expect to wait.</p>

					<li><i class="fa fa-cutlery"></i> Type of food: Hamburgers</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
					<p><strong>My comments:</strong> If you say burger in NY, you'll probably think of this place. I must confess I am NOT a fan of this burgers. My humble opinion is that this place is overrated. There are SO many good places for hamburgers... but still... I have to say the've done an amazing job and created an empire.</p>
					<p><strong>My favorite hamburgers are hands down</strong>: <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/burger-joint-new-york-3">Burger Joint</a>, <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/umami-burger-greenwich-village-new-york">Umami</a>, and <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/minetta-tavern-new-york">Minetta Tavern</a> a little bit more pricy but worth the experience. I went with my aunt and sat at the bar. The bartender kept hitting on her! </p>

				<p><strong>My comments:</strong>  This place is where I made my first two international (yet latin) friends in NYC. It has the sweetest waiter in the world and serves the best pizza: Bianche Tartufo (Italian Style). </p>
				<p>If you are near Union Square, you should check <a href="https://www.yelp.es/biz/ribalta-pizza-new-york">Ribalta</a>. I was there with Italian friends and my parents (who lived in Milano for 7 years) and we had a blast! Plus, on fridays they play live music.</p>

				<p><strong>My comments:</strong>  I was here twice. Once for dining and one for Brunch. Both times was great, as for brunch you have the little terrace outside, and dinner the candle-light gives the place a very intimate look. For each day of the week they have a special which makes the choice more interesting. Definetly worth the visit. The neighbourhood is great.</p>

				<p><strong>My comments:</strong> Dinner with american, spanish and italian friends. What better choice than an Italian place?

				<p><strong>My comments:</strong> If you like dumplings and are willing to wait for a bit, this is the place to go. A trully chinese experience, with dumplings filled with soup (watch out for mouth burns). Don't expect fanciness. FYI: Cash only!</p>
				<p>Once you are done eating, walk 2 blocks to <a href="http://www.apothekenyc.com/">Apothéke</a> bar. When I was there, there was live music. Evertything is build around "chemistry" concept. Even the lights are made of chemistry's bottles. The cocktails are around $16-$20.</p>

				</div>
				<p><strong>My comments:</strong> Before coming to this place I defined myself as a "non spicy" person, but you know...food pushes us to expand our limits. Everything I tried here had some degree of spiciness and still I found it SO good. I had chilly pork dumplings and the Graffiti burger.
				Also, I had a "first time" in this restaurant: we repeated a dessert! (WARM TRUFFLE ALMOND STRAWBERRIES, PEPPER ICE CREAM) SOOO good.
				This is the sort of place that is defined as "a whole in the wall". It is one of the tiniest restaurants I've been in NY and still one of the best ones. I was there to celebrate that a friend got the green card! Here is where I discovered one of my favorite wines: HANGING VINE, CABERNET SAUVIGNON, CALIFORNIA 2014</p>

				<p><strong>My comments:</strong> It took me almost 7 months to finally have proper argentinean asado in NYC. Eventually everything arrives in life!. I went to celebrate the birthday of a close friend and it felt like having dinner in a classic Argentinean place. Very good meat quality and authentic flavors. If you are craving for some dulce de leche, the desserts won't disappoint you.</p>

				<p><strong>My comments:</strong> This place stole my heat at first sight. I went here on a date and I was transported to Paris, where I had the chance to live in a few of years ago. My choice was seabass and it was so good that i started laughing. It was the first time ever that this happened to me! </p>

				<p><strong>My comments:</strong> Think sex and the city: high heels, LBD, a cocktail...welcome to Buddakan! The ambience has a lounge vibe and the dim lights give the perfect touch. It is a very popular place (and touristic I must say). You can't go wrong dining here: the edemame dumplings were amazing as well as the pork belly dumplings. The Crying Chocolate that we got for dessert (and birthday cake for my friend) was on point.</p>

The service is very friendly and attentive. Dessert: green tea Mille crepe, it is something different yet good!.If you arrive early, go to the bar downstairs for a drink.</p>

				<p><strong>My comments:</strong> Great discovery for me. I was invited for dinner here. They picked this place, owned by Mario Batali -same owner as <a href="https://www.eataly.com/">Eataly</a> (if you havent been there: GO. That's a command.)- I love going to places with people of the same origin that know the food and suggest what's best on the menu. I had an incredible Tuna with Heirloom Tomatoes, Cucumber and Summer Gazpacho. As a dessert I had the best ricotta ice cream in the world. I am still dreaming of it! </p>

			<p>This is a small barrio with a lot of locally-owned clothing and gift stores. It's most fun to walk it during the daytime.
			It's located in the Civic Center area. You should walk the 3 to 4 blocks on Hayes Street between Franklin and about
			Laguna Streets. </p>
			<p>A couple of my favorite restaurants are on Hayes, including:</p>
			<li> <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/absinthe-brasserie-and-bar-san-francisco-2"target="_blank">ABSINTHE</a>: They have fantastic hamburgers, french onion soup, and salads, and a full bar. (Hayes and Gough Street)</li>
			<li><a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/suppenk%C3%BCche-san-francisco-2"target="_blank">SUPPENKUCHEN</a>: Amazing german food. I was here with friends, totally worth it. They have a great variety of german beers(Hayes and Laguna Street).</li>

			<p>This area has tons of hipster clothing and gift shops, record stores, restaurants, cafes, and bars. It is happening all the time, from about noon until 2:00 AM.  Some of the best restaurants in SF are on Valencia or Mission Streets..You can walk up and down Valencia Street and find lots of great stuff to look at (and buy) and places for a drink or a coffee </p>
			<p>For dinner, try to get a reservation at:</p>
			<ul>
			<li> <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/locanda-san-francisco"target="_blank">LOCANDA</a>: Great italian food</li>
			<li><a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/foreign-cinema-san-francisco"target="_blank">FOREIGN CINEMA </a>: This place is great for brunch, lunch or dinner. It's pricey but worth it.</li>  
			
			<li><a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/delfina-san-francisco"target="_blank">DELFINA</a>: Another worth-trying italian food. Mind you: they don't serve pizza, you'd have to get that on Pizzeria Delfina, located right next to the restaurant.(18th and Guerrero Streets)</li>  
			</ul>
			</p>If you are up for a drink, check out this cool places:</p>
			<ul>
			<li><a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/zeitgeist-san-francisco"target="_blank">ZEITGEIST</a>:It always gets voted to be the "best dive bar in San Francisco (Valencia Street at Duboce (near Market Street)</li> 
			<li><a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-chapel-san-francisco"target="_blank">THE CHAPEL</a>:A good music venue. Lots of bands play there and you might want to check it out.  It's also a bar and a restaurant. </li>

			<p>The Tenderloin District used to be a "bad neighborhood". It was full of drunks and junkies, and people who were "down on their luck". There is still a lot of that but now the young hipsters have taken over the old bars and restaurants and stores, so it is very cool to go hang out there. This is not a very good part of town and I would recommend going there with some other people along.</p>

			<p>This is another shopping and restaurant area.  It is mostly fun to wander there during the daytime.  There are lots of small independently owned shops there. It is more conservative than The Mission District, as far as shopping, but it is still fun to see.  Plenty of good restaurants there, too, that you can just walk into without a reservation.  
			<p>Two restaurants that are located over Fillmore st. and that I like are:</p>
