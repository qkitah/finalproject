			<h2>I STARTED THIS WEBPAGE....</h2><p>Because I have bad memory. I wanted a happy place where to browse all the things that people send me and make me smile, inspire me and make me reflect. I hope by sharing it with you to inspire you as well. <a href="index.html" class="signature">Julieta</a></p>

	<h5>Noah's Ark</h5>
		<p>Everything I need to know, I learned from Noah's Ark.</p>
			<ul id="nohas-list">
				<li> <strong>ONE:</strong> Don't miss the boat.</li>
				<li> <strong>TWO:</strong> Remember that we are all in the same boat!</li>
				<li> <strong>THREE:</strong> Plan ahead. It wasn't raining when Noah built the Ark.</li>
				<li> <strong>FOUR: </strong>Stay fit. When you're 60 years old, someone may ask you to do something really big.</li>
				<li> <strong>FIVE:</strong> Don't listen to critics; just get on with the job that needs to be done.</li>
				<li> <strong>SIX:</strong> Build your future on high ground.</li>
				<li> <strong>SEVEN:</strong> For safety's sake, travel in pairs.</li>
				<li> <strong>EIGHT:</strong> Speed isn't always an advantage. The snails were on board with the cheetahs.</li>
				<li> <strong>NINE:</strong> When you're stressed, float awhile.</li>
				<li> <strong>TEN:</strong> Remember, the Ark was built by amateurs; the Titanic by professionals.</li>
				<li><strong>ELEVEN:</strong> No matter the storm, when you are with God, there's always a rainbow waiting.</li>
